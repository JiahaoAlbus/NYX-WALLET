# Privacy Policy (Draft)

Effective Date: 2026-02-09

NYX WALLIET is a non-custodial wallet. We do not store your private keys, seed phrases, or biometric data on our servers.

## Information We Collect
- Device and app diagnostics (crash logs, performance metrics) if you opt in via system settings.
- Public blockchain addresses you view or use inside the app.
- Network metadata required to communicate with blockchain RPC providers.

## Information We Do Not Collect
- Seed phrases, private keys, or biometric data.
- Wallet recovery information (no recovery/escrow).

## How We Use Information
- Provide wallet functionality (address display, transaction creation, network requests).
- Improve reliability (crash/error diagnostics if enabled).

## Third-Party Services
NYX WALLIET connects to third-party blockchain RPC providers and public APIs (swap/NFT data). These providers may receive your IP address and public wallet addresses as part of network requests.

## Data Retention
We do not store wallet secrets. App data is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app.

## Security
We use device security (Secure Enclave, Keychain) and biometric gating to protect local keys. You are responsible for safeguarding your device and seed phrase.

## Changes
We may update this policy. Material changes will be communicated in-app or on our website.
